                Our colon is said to be the sewage system of the body. Imagine
                what would happen if all sewage pipes in your city got so
                clogged up with waste that the system failed to remove it. It
                wouldn’t take long before a crisis developed, and a huge
                sanitation problem would threaten society! Similarly, if our
                colon fails to eliminate waste and gases effectively from our
                bodies, food stuck in the colon will start to ferment, causing a
                whole cascade of health issues.

            Paying attention to our digestive system is vital, and now as

            As modern humans living in a modern world, there is no argument that
            nowadays we are bombarded by harsh chemical toxins. They are in our
            water, the air we breathe, our food, cleaning supplies, skin
            products, clothes, and more. We absorb these toxins with our lungs,
            our skin, and the water and food we consume.

          <p className="text-blog">
            <span className="bold-text">
              How does our body rid itself of these toxins?
            </span>{' '}
            The main channels of elimination involve sweat, urine, and feces.
            But consumption of devitalized and refined foods, lack of healthy
            bowel movements, stress, and lack of bodily movement makes our colon
            muscle weak. It also causes the colon walls to be covered in
            unwanted waste, which makes it difficult for feces to evacuate
            completely.

          <p className="text-blog">
            <span className="bold-text">
              What is a healthy bowel movement like?
            </span>{' '}
            You can get an idea of how clean your colon is by the amount of
            wiping you have to do after you had your bowel movement. After a
            healthy bowel movement, toilet tissue should be completely clean. If
            you have to wipe a few times, that’s a sign of a gut issue; it gives
            you an idea of how much your colon wall is covered with toxic waste
            matter.

          <p className="text-blog">
            With colon being your{' '}
            <span className="bold-text">major elimination organ</span>, it can
            be holding on to a huge burden of toxic load, creating an unhealthy
            flora and breeding bad bacteria, yeast, and parasites. There is no
            wonder why adding salad or fruit on top of such an unbalanced
            ecosystem does not make you feel any better! This is why a perfectly
            healthy diet is not enough.

            Over the years as a colon hydrotherapist, I have seen the freeing
            results colonics offer. In my practice, I often see clients that
            have regular bowel movements but somehow still feel sluggish,
            bloated, and suffer from brain fog. During colonic, they cannot
            believe how much waste they’ve been carrying around; releasing the
            waste during the session inspires many sighs of relief. Energy comes
            back to the body. Headaches, puffiness and pains go away. In some
            cases clients can literally and physically see better, and mentally
            their focus increases.

              Let me give you a behind the scenes look and break down the
              colonic process for you.

            You are laying on a table similar to massage table, starting on your
            left side with your knees bent, in a fetal position. Later in a
            session you turn to your back, so the therapist can assist with
            abdominal massage. Warm filtered water is introduced into your colon
            through a small tool that is lubricated with organic coconut oil and
            gently inserted about an inch and a half into your rectum. As the
            warm water enters, you’ll feel a fullness as your colon fills up,
            then a feeling of relief as it empties. Water flows in and out of
            the body simultaneously which doesn’t allow pressure to build up
            (unlike machine methods or open systems of colonic) making it safe
            and comfortable practice. All waste is drained away discreetly in a
            closed system with no mess or odors.

          <p className="text-blog">
            The treatment takes about 40 to 60 minutes, helping you reset your
            systems and create a clean and healthy environment for your good
            bacteria to flourish. This takes a lot of pressure off your system,
            and immediately brings lost of energy and vitality back into your
            body.

            The part of the <span className="bold-text">therapy</span> in Colon
            Hydrotherapy is stimulating your colon muscle (like taking your
            colon to a gym). It mimics the peristaltic movement to make your
            colon muscle strong, so it can create healthy movement on its own.
            After the treatment, you are getting not only a cleaner but a
            stronger colon that can now eliminate waste much more efficiently in
            the future. Just by adding colonics to your detox routine, you can
            improve your energy levels, elimination, digestive issues, skin
            conditions, and your emotional and mental states of mind.

              good news is that knowledge and choice is power. Both chronic
