        Colonic is a <b>thorough cleansing</b> of the colon (large intestine),
        using only warm purified water. During the treatment there is a
        continuous inflow and outflow of water that doesnâ€™t allow pressure to
        build up, which makes it for a comfortable and safe session. The
        therapist is with you during the whole session, doing firm abdominal
        massage to assure gentle and effective release. It usually takes 45 mins
        to an hour to empty out a colon
